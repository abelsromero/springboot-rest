= K8s Load Balancing

The project includes a test to monitor quality of load balancing in K8s.

== Testing

. Run `./scripts/deploy_k8s.sh`
+
This will deploy the app twice, as "consumer" and "backend".
The latter is being called form the first.

. Enable access to Consumer endpoint.
The easiest is to use `port-forward`.

 kubectl port-forward svc/consumer 8080:8080

. Monitor consumer logs

 stern consumer

. Call Consumer endpoint with

 curl "http://localhost:8080/consume"
 curl "http://localhost:8080/consume" -H 'Connection: CLOSE'

You'll see the first one always hits the same instance.


NOTE: Using `spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client-loadbalancer` requires granting additional K8s API permissions to the app.
